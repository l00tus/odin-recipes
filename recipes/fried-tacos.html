    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried tacos are surprisingly hard to come by at restaurants. Typically, just the usual taco on a soft tortilla shell is offered, which can get old after a while.</p>
    <p>These fried tacos are stuffed with seasoned shredded chicken and cheddar cheese, then fried to crispy golden perfection. They're such a delicious change-up from classic tacos with a plain soft shell, and theyâ€™re sure to be a hit with anyone who tries them.</p>
